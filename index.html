    <div id="ember1115" class="ember-view">  <span class="lt-line-clamp__raw-line">Nathaniel is a young data scientist with strong academic background. He is very focused on solving business problems through analytics. If needed he can jump into technical details doing his own research or interacting with other team members. He is eager to learn, both technical and business subjects.
Very easy to get along with, he uses this characteristic to interact with non-technical businessperson to deliver a comprehensive and effective solution, balancing time and quality of the work he is doing.
It was a pleasure to work with Nathaniel!</span>

I've recruited Nathaniel after he graduated from UC Berkeley and his motivation for making a change and growth stood out. I lead an internal ai/analytics consultancy in a fast growing Brazilian bank -- the connection and communication is highly important; Nathaniel was able to build a fluent communication with other teams and departments in the bank. The delivery was also good with being able to complete MVPs and some further explorations and refinement for 3 projects within 1.5 months. I would highly recommend Nathaniel for a fast-growing and agile data science / consultancy environment that we had; and i'm sure he will shine in other places too. </span>
